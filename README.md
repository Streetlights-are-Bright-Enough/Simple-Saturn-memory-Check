Hello to anyone reading this, My name is Streets or Dwizzi. First real time using github as i mostly write for my own projects and never really distribute them.
Find enclosed a simple memory test for the sega saturn. At the current moment it is untested as my pc is on its way out the door and i am uploading this from my work PC 
This was written for Game shops to easily test modded saturns to make sure they still work internally after modding and for others i guess to do so. 


Any problems please let me know.
